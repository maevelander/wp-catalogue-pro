Keen to do a translation? Yay! Here's how to do it:

1. Get the latest version of the plugin
2. Download and install Poedit or another translation tool of your choice
3. In Poedit, go to File > Preferences, and enter your own details so that when you save your translation it will be properly labelled.
4. In the plugin folder /languages open up the default.po file in Poedit. Poedit will show you all the bits of text (called "translatable strings") that need to be translated.
5. Translate each string into your language
6. When you're finished, do a "save as" which should generate a .po and a .mo file. Make sure you name these files in the correct format. For this plugin it will be wpc-xx_XX.po where the xx_XX is the language and country code as found here > http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language
7. Email me the .po and .mo files  and I will add them to the plugin for everyone.
8. Done. Now everyone can enjoy the plugin in their own language.
